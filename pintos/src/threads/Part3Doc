Thread.h: Added recent_cpu and nice as instance variables
Thread.c: Added load_avg as class variable

Thread.c: Modified thread_get_nice, thread_set_nice, thread_get_recent_cpu, thread_get_load_avg to edit/return
correct values.

Modified thread_tick to re-calculate priority values for all threads on every fourth tick and then re-sort the ready list. Use priority variable as the mlfqs priority and ready_list as the queue.

Added mlfqs_recalculate function to compute new priority value from formula.
Added compare_priority function as the sorting function for ready_list.




To Do

Recalculate load_avg and recent_cpu once per second.
Figure out interrupt enabling/disabling.
